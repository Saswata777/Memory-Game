# Memory Game


1. Game Title: Memory Game
   - A classic memory game implemented using JavaScript.

2. Game Description:
   - The Memory Game is a popular brain-training game where players need to match pairs of cards within a certain time limit.

3. Objective:
   - The objective of the game is to find and match all the pairs of cards on the game board.

4. Game Features:
   - The game board consists of a grid of facedown cards.
   - Each card has a unique symbol or image hidden on its back.
   - The cards are shuffled and randomly placed on the game board at the beginning of each round.
   - The player can flip two cards at a time by clicking on them.
   - If the two flipped cards have the same symbol, they remain face-up and the player earns points.
   - If the two flipped cards have different symbols, they are flipped back face-down.
   - The player continues flipping cards until all pairs have been matched.

5. Game Controls:
   - Players can interact with the game using the mouse or touch input.
   - Clicking or tapping a card flips it to reveal the hidden symbol.

6. Game Logic:
   - The game keeps track of the number of flipped cards and checks for matches.
   - If two cards match, they remain face-up and the player's score increases.
   - If two cards don't match, they are flipped back face-down.
   - The game ends when all pairs have been found or when the time limit expires.

7. Scoring System:
   - The player's score is based on the number of successful matches made.
     
   - Additional points can be awarded for completing the game within a shorter time or with fewer moves.

8. Game Over:
   - When the game is over, a modal or message displays the player's final score and time taken.
   - Players can choose to play again or exit the game.
